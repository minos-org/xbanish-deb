Description: Banish the mouse cursor when typing, show it again when the mouse moves.
 xbanish hides the mouse cursor when you start typing, and shows it again when
 the mouse cursor moves or a mouse button is pressed.  This is similar to
 xterm's pointerMode setting, but xbanish works globally in the X11 session.
 .
 unclutter's -keystroke mode is supposed to do this, but it's broken[0].  I
 looked into fixing it, but the unclutter source code is terrible, so I wrote
 xbanish in a few hours.
 .
 The name comes from ratpoison's "banish" command that sends the cursor to the
 corner of the screen.
